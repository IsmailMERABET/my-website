                Variational Methods for Complex Phenomena in Engineering Structures and Materials<br>
                Funding period: 2020-2023</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Nonlinear bending theories for thin elastic objects have recently attracted considerable attention within mathematical research. One reason for this is the unresolved mathematical issues arising when allowing for large deformations and self-avoidance. The underlying theory is a higher regularity theory, where Geometric Measure Theory (GMT) and the rigorous justification of Kirchhoffâ€™s bending theory have generated interest. This project aims to advance knowledge in this area, focusing on the interaction of curved rod-like objects with shells, and investigates the stability of different numerical methods for this problem.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Programmatic advances in the precise modeling of elastic materials whose shape can be controlled via external stimuli have created new opportunities for engineering applications. This project focuses on the bending behavior of nematic liquid crystal elastomers, addressing the mathematical challenges related to the design of optimal material configurations, their stability, and robustness under different physical conditions. Our approach integrates variational methods with nonlinear elasticity theory, providing a comprehensive analysis of these materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Designing and analyzing numerical methods for shape optimization problems typically requires the handling of non-smooth shapes. This project aims to provide efficient approximation schemes for non-smooth convex shapes with applications in optimal insulation, minimal resistance, and other phenomena. The research explores variational techniques combined with geometric analysis to achieve desired outcomes efficiently.</p>

                Variational Methods for Stochastic PDEs<br>
                Funding period: 2018-2021</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Spaces of functions of bounded variation provide an attractive framework to describe material interfaces and discontinuities. This project focuses on developing and analyzing efficient numerical schemes for approximating such functions. The reliability and stability of these schemes are essential for predicting material behaviors, especially in cases involving fracture and phase transitions.</p>
